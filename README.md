## MCMultiServer

MCMultiServer is a basic Minecraft Server command line tool.
This was a school project and has no intent to be further developed.

## Building

Visual Studio 2013-15 is recommended (May work on 2010, but not tested). 
Though some of the code	work was paved for UNIX/Linux Support,      
It is by far unusable in those systems.	

## License

MIT/BSD license, I dont care if this project gets forked or not,
just make sure you give credit.
